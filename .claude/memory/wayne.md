# Wayne — Change Log

What Wayne changed, newest first. One entry per change the other two might depend on.

**Why:** the three of us work on mutually exclusive packages ([[team-split]]), so nobody reads
anyone else's diffs. This is where a change that crosses a package boundary gets announced.

**How to apply:** append an entry when you touch anything outside your own package — `common/`,
a shared constant, a file schema, a function signature, a cached artefact under `outputs/`. Purely
internal work inside your own subsystem does not need an entry.

**Role:** C — the app shell first (it blocks nothing but defines everyone's "done"), then
`src/shm/`, then the two upgrades: SHM via rainflow, and the app beyond minimal. See
[[team-split]].
